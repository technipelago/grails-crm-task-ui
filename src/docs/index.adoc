that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Task Management User Interface Plugin

This plugin provide user interfaces for managing tasks in {gr8crm} applications. If depends on the +crm-task+ plugin for low level services and persistence.
A *Task* in {gr8crm} is a domain instance that represents a unit of work that has been done in the past or is scheduled to be done in the future.
A task is very similar to a calendar item, it has a start time and a duration.

With this plugin you get a basic *CRUD* controller where you can create new, search for and update existing tasks.
You also get a calendar that can display tasks in monthly, weekly and daily views.
Tasks can be associated with other domain instances and the plugin provide a GSP template that you can inject in other
GSP pages to get a list of tasks associated with a domain instance.

== Create a new task

To create a new task you visit +crmTask/create+ which will show an input form where you can add task details.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the +Search+ button to search for tasks matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all tasks will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one task, a list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one task, then details for that task will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the +list+ view and go directly to the +show+ view.

== Task details

The task details page +crmTask/show+ shows all the details for a selected task.
Here you will find task name, start time, priority, etc.
