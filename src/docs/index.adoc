== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Task Management User Interface Plugin

This plugin provide user interfaces for managing tasks in {gr8crm} applications. It depends on the +crm-task+ plugin for low level services and persistence.
A *Task* in {gr8crm} is a domain instance that represents a unit of work that has been done in the past or is scheduled to be done in the future.
A task is very similar to a calendar item, it has a start time and a duration.

With this plugin you get a basic *CRUD* controller where you can create new, search for and update existing tasks.
You also get a calendar that can display tasks in monthly, weekly and daily views.
Tasks can be associated with other domain instances and the plugin provide a GSP template that you can inject in other
GSP pages to get a list of tasks associated with a domain instance.

== Create a new task

To create a new task you visit +crmTask/create+ which will show an input form where you can add task details.

== Search for tasks

To query for tasks you visit +crmTask/index+ which will show the query form.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the +Search+ button to search for tasks matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all tasks will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one task, a list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one task, then details for that task will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the +list+ view and go directly to the +show+ view.

== Task details

The task details page +crmTask/show+ shows all the details for a selected task.
Here you will find task name, start time, priority, etc.

If the +crm-tags+ plugin is installed you can see existing tags and add new tags to a task.

== Edit task details

To edit task details you hit the +Edit+ button. This will display the edit page +crmTask/edit+.
Here you can alter values and then hit +Save+ to store the new values in the database.

== Attenders

A task can have a collection of attenders. Attenders can be people stored as a +CrmContact+ domain instance,
or just name and address stored in the +CrmTaskAttender+ instance.
Task attenders are not enabled by default. If you set the config option +crm.task.attenders.enabled+ to +true+ you will
get an extra tab in the task details page. This tab will display attenders and let you add attenders to the task.

== Calendar

The CrmCalendarController +crmCalendar/index+ displays a month/week/day calendar with all the tasks in your database.
The calendar is based on the http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/[FullCalendar^] jQuery plugin.
A +username+ query parameter can be specified to filter events for a specific user. Otherwise it will display
all events in the current tenant.
